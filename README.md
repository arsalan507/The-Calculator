# Total Price Calculator

This is a simple web-based **Total Price Calculator** for calculating the final price of an item, including a gross profit margin, shipping cost, and additional fees. This project allows employees to quickly calculate the price to be charged to clients, considering these costs.

## Features
- **Purchase Price Input**: The base price of the item.
- **Shipping Price Input**: The shipping cost that is added to the purchase price.
- **15% Gross Profit**: Automatically adds a 15% profit margin to the purchase price.
- **8% Additional Fee**: Adds an 8% fee to the total amount (including shipping).
- **Simple UI**: A straightforward, easy-to-use calculator interface with live results.

## How It Works

1. The user enters the **purchase price** of the item.
2. The user enters the **shipping price** for the item.
3. The calculator automatically:
   - Adds a **15% gross profit** to the purchase price.
   - Adds the **shipping cost** to the total.
   - Finally, it applies an **8% fee** to the total.
4. The result is displayed as the **final total price**, rounded to two decimal places.

### Example Calculation:
- Purchase Price: $100
- Shipping Price: $20

The final price would be calculated as:
- Step 1: Add 15% to the purchase price: $100 + 15% = $115.
- Step 2: Add the shipping price: $115 + $20 = $135.
- Step 3: Add 8% to the total: $135 + 8% = $145.80.
  
So the final total would be **$145.80**.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/total-price-calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the folder**:
   ```bash
   cd total-price-calculator
   ```

3. **Open the project**:
   - You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

4. **Ensure the logo is in place**:
   - Make sure your logo file (e.g., `logo.png`) is in the same folder as `index.html`.
   - If needed, update the `<img src="logo.png" />` line in the HTML to reflect the correct logo file name.

## Usage

Once you open the `index.html` file, follow these steps:
1. Enter the **purchase price** in the provided input box.
2. Enter the **shipping price**.
3. Click the **"Calculate Total"** button to see the final total price.

The result will be displayed on the screen below the button.
